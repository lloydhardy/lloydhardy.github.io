# PHP Developer

Hi, My Name Is Lloyd. I'm an **IT Consultant** specialising in [ERP Software](https://www.erp.ie), Rapper and.. a **PHP Developer** of Business Software. I want to share code I found useful with you to save you some time and provide you _freedom_ in using these classes by using the AGPLv3. 

If you would like to hire me to work on your project remotely (I'm usually on the other side of the `Hello World`), please feel free to [message me](mailto:lloydhardy@gmail.com) and maybe we can build cool things together :)
