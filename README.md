# PHP Developer

## Hi, My Name Is Lloyd

I'm an **IT Consultant** specialising in [ERP Software](https://www.erp.ie), Rapper and.. a `PHP Developer` of Business Software. I want to share code I found useful with you to save you some time and provide you _freedom_ in using these classess by using the AGPLv3. 

If you would like to hire me to work on your project remotely (I'm usually on the other side of the World), please feel free to [message me](mailto:lloydhardy@gmail.com) and maybe we can build cool things together :)
